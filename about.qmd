Welcome to my blog, a personal journey through the intricate and fascinating world of Machine Learning. My name is Ziming â€˜Joannaâ€™ Fang, and I'm thrilled to have you join me in exploring various aspects of this dynamic field.

Currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science and Applications at Virginia Tech, I have a solid background in computer science and a keen interest in the practical applications of machine learning. This blog is not just a platform for sharing knowledge but also a reflection of my passion for understanding and leveraging the power of data and algorithms.

Here's what you can expect from my blog:

1. **Probability Theory and Random Variables**: We'll start with the basics, exploring how probability theory and random variables form the foundation of machine learning. Expect deep dives into theory, practical examples, and intriguing problems.

2. **Clustering**: Clustering algorithms are pivotal in understanding data segmentation. Iâ€™ll share insights on various clustering methods, their applications, and their role in data analysis.

3. **Linear and Nonlinear Regression**: A journey through the realm of regression analysis, covering both linear and nonlinear approaches. I'll elucidate these concepts with real-world examples and hands-on coding.

4. **Classification**: Delve into the world of classification algorithms. Iâ€™ll break down complex concepts into digestible content, making it easier to understand how these algorithms categorize data.

5. **Anomaly/Outlier Detection**: We'll explore the techniques used to identify anomalies in data sets, an important aspect of data analysis and security.

Each post will be enriched with machine learning code snippets and at least one data visualization, ensuring a comprehensive and practical learning experience.

I'm building this blog with Quarto and hosting it on GitHub Pages. This approach aligns with my belief in transparency, accessibility, and the power of open-source tools. You'll find my blog not just informative but also a testament to the power of programmatic website creation.

Outside of academics, my experience as a Software Engineer at Avocado LLC and as a Research Assistant at the Mind Music Machine Lab has equipped me with a unique blend of skills. Whether it's automating PDF news article processing with Python and ChatGPT, or applying sentiment extraction programs for emotional sonification in storytelling, I've always been at the intersection of innovation and practicality.

So, whether you're a fellow machine learning enthusiast, a curious learner, or someone interested in the intersection of data and technology, I invite you to join me on this enlightening journey. Let's explore the world of machine learning together!

Happy reading and learning!
